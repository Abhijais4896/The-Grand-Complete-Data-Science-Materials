# üç∑ Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on its physicochemical features using machine learning algorithms. The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and includes red or white wine samples, with a quality score ranging from 0 to 10.

## üìå Problem Statement

Given various features of wine such as acidity, sugar content, pH, and alcohol level, the goal is to build a regression/classification model that can predict the quality score of a wine sample.
