# üïí Time Series Multi-Store Sales Prediction

Accurately forecasting sales across multiple stores is critical for inventory planning, staffing, and decision-making in the retail sector. This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate future sales using historical time series data from various stores.

---

## üìå Project Overview

Retail businesses often face challenges in predicting store-level sales due to fluctuating demand patterns, seasonal trends, promotions, and holidays. In this project, we:

* Analyze historical sales data from multiple stores
* Identify seasonality, trends, and external factors
* Build predictive models using machine learning and time series techniques
* Evaluate the models using standard regression metrics

## üß† Techniques & Models Used

This project combines classical time series modeling with machine learning and deep learning techniques:

* **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Trend, seasonality, and outlier detection
* **Feature Engineering**: Lag features, rolling means, holiday flags, promotions
* **Models**:

  * XGBoost / LightGBM
  * Facebook Prophet / NeuralProphet
  * ARIMA / SARIMA
  * LSTM / GRU (for sequence modeling)
* **Evaluation Metrics**:

  * RMSE, MAE, MAPE

## üìä Dataset Overview

* **Columns**:

  * `store_id`: Unique store identifier
  * `date`: Date of transaction
  * `sales`: Daily sales
  * `promotion`: Binary feature indicating promotional events
  * `holiday`: Boolean feature for public holidays
  * `store_type`, `region`, etc. (for categorical segmentation)

* **Source**: \[Add link if from Kaggle or UCI, or write "synthetic dataset created for experimentation"]

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the Jupyter notebooks in order:

   * `EDA.ipynb`: Data exploration and visualization
   * `feature_engineering.ipynb`: Creating useful time-based features
   * `model_training.ipynb`: Training and evaluation of models

3. (Optional) Deploy using Streamlit or Flask to create an interactive dashboard.

## üìà Results

* XGBoost achieved **RMSE: XX.XX**, outperforming linear models.
* Facebook Prophet handled seasonality and holidays effectively.
* LSTM model captured temporal dependencies but required more tuning.

Visualizations comparing **actual vs predicted sales** show the model's ability to forecast weekly and monthly trends for each store.

## üõ†Ô∏è Possible Improvements

* Incorporate external features like weather or regional events
* Implement hyperparameter tuning with Optuna or GridSearchCV
* Use hierarchical/multivariate models (e.g., DeepAR, Temporal Fusion Transformers)
* Real-time forecasting with API deployment
