This project uses Deep Learning techniques to predict a person’s gender and age from facial images. It employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on facial image datasets to perform multi-output classification.

✨ Features
Predicts Gender: Male or Female.

Predicts Age Group: Multi-class age group classification.

Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Supports real-time webcam prediction.

Built using TensorFlow / Keras, OpenCV, and NumPy.

Pretrained weights support transfer learning for better accuracy.
