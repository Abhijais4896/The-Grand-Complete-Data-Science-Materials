The main goal of this project is to build a system that predicts whether a loan should be approved or rejected based on the applicant’s personal, financial, and credit details. This system can help banks and financial institutions make data-driven and consistent lending decisions.

🔍 Problem Statement
Banks receive thousands of loan applications every year. Manually checking and verifying each application takes time and may lead to human error or bias. An automated loan prediction system can reduce manual effort, improve efficiency, and ensure fair evaluation.

📊 Input Parameters
Some of the key features used for prediction include:

Gender

Marital Status

Dependents

Education

Employment Type

Applicant Income

Co-applicant Income

Loan Amount

Loan Term

Credit History

Property Area

🎯 Target Variable
Loan_Status: Whether the loan should be approved (Y) or not (N)

⚙️ System Workflow
Data Collection
Used a publicly available dataset containing details of previous applicants.

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Feature scaling (if needed)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understanding feature distributions

Visualizing relationships between variables and target

Model Building
Trained multiple machine learning models like:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

XGBoost

Model Evaluation
Evaluated model performance using:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

ROC-AUC Score

💡 Key Features
Predicts loan approval status based on multiple input factors.

Trained using real-world data.

High accuracy and fast predictions.

Optional user interface for easy usage.
